# Example Projects
A ReactJS project, written in TypeScript which implements a (UI Framework) Tree and itÂ´s functionality. The functionality manages a object array with 0...n children of the same object array. This managed object array will be mapped (after changes are made) to a styled data array which the tree component needs.

The goal of this is to reach a separation between data and styled data for easy efficient data manipulation.

- Used UI Frameworks:
  - [ant.design](https://ant.design/)
  - [mui.com](https://mui.com)

## Functionality contains:
- [ ] Lazy data loading simulation (real world usecase is to get only needed data from backend & database)
- [ ] Add root/child node
- [ ] Delete root/child node
- [ ] Rename root/child node
- [ ] TreeData manipulation in whole project (mobx store)
- [ ] alphabetical sorting of root/child nodes
- [ ] manual sorting via drag&drop of root/child nodes
- [ ] separation between data and styled data
